//! Portfolio-level aggregate over many markets, families, and traders.
//!
//! A market maker holds positions, LP shares, and a single STRK balance
//! across N markets and possibly multiple families. The naive way to
//! reconstruct that view is `N × (position + lp_info + distribution +
//! balance)` sequential reads — at 50 ms RTT a 20-market book costs
//! upward of a wall-clock second per refresh.
//!
//! [`Portfolio`] composes [`BulkReader`] (Wave 1) so every read in
//! `Portfolio::load` is fanned out concurrently, then post-processes the
//! results into a [`BTreeMap`]-keyed aggregate the MM can query in O(log
//! N).
//!
//! ## Conventions
//!
//! * `Family` is reused from [`crate::bulk`] — no new tag.
//! * Position valuation uses `total_collateral` as a conservative
//!   fallback when the pricing primitives aren't enabled. A future wave
//!   may swap in an EV-based valuation; the field is named
//!   `current_value_f64` so the API doesn't shift when that lands.
//! * `total_strk_balance` is supplied by the caller because the SDK
//!   doesn't have a hard dependency on a specific ERC-20 reader. The
//!   constructor accepts `0` if the caller doesn't care.
